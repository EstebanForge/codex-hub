# JavaScript Hooks

To modify the behavior of existing fields, Carbon Fields exposes several hooks.

See [@wordpress/hooks](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/designers-developers/developers/packages/packages-hooks/ ) for more details about the usage of the hooks module.

#### Containers

### `carbon-fields.register-container-type`

Used to filter the container settings. It receives the type of the container, the rendering context and the React component used to render the content as arguments.

### `carbon-fields.<type>.<context>`

Used to modify the container's component. It receives the original Container component and returns a new wrapped component.

**Note:** The context can be `classic` or `gutenberg`.
